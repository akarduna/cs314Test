# cs314Test
The goal of this porject is to help autimate testing for cs314. Currently their are three scripts, pytest and rmoteTest are used to create a dictionary of server responses for the tests that the class wrote.
currently they both just save the dictionary to the output.csv file, whith the first column being the key of the dictionary(team number) and the second column being the value(A list of distance lists).
The third script is loadData, which just converts the csv back to the dictioanry. 

I am going to continue working on this as the semester continues, if you have any suggestions or would like to help contribute please let me know either at akarduna@colostate.edu or in the slack at Alex karduna. 

## Future Ideas
* Make the tests run for all tests in the student repo.
* Add more single server testing
* Come up with a better way of showing the user their server response(dictionary is very clunky)
* Give the user more control through the comand line. (should be able to pass arguemnts to the program and have it run difrent scenerios rather then having to go in and edit the code.
